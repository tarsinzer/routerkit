v13

- You can now disable the navigation of a routerLink by passing undefined and null.
Previously the routerLink directive used to accept these two values as equivalent to an empty string.

- Migrates `[routerLink]=""` in templates to `[routerLink]="[]"` because these links are likely intended to route to the current page with updated fragment/query params.
